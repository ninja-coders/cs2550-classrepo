Through scholarship, discussion, creative work, and play testing, this course will explore the emerging fields of participatory theater, interactive performance, social gaming, and system-based story telling. We will study the basics of game design, the fundamentals of physical and social gaming, and the history of interactivity as a theatrical device. Students will design physical and tabletop games, ambulatory experiences, social experiments, and interactive environments. Emphasis is on creative output and integrating participatory systems and audience agency with emergent narrative.

Does sex get in the way of friendship? Are your friends mostly of the same sex/gender/sexuality? Is it harder to make friends with persons of different sex/gender/sexuality? How have friendships changed as people have become more embedded in online communities? The course will begin with a consideration of current conversations about friendship, including popular TV serials -- such as \\\"Friends,\\\" \\\"Sex and the City,\\\" \\\"New Girl,\\\" and \\\"The Inbetweeners\\\" -- in which friendships are lived and variously configured through sexual relationships. What could we make about meanings of friendship and sex, and their inter-relationship, in contemporary American culture? We will read various texts that form historical threads that inform our contemporary concepts and practices of friendship and romance. Readings will include Winthrop, Plato, Cicero, Biblical sources, St. Augustine, St. Aquinas, Montaigne, Bray, Marcus, Sedgwick, and Foucault. Finally, we will return to contemporary America, asking what gay marriage, Facebook, and changing conceptions of masculinity/femininity are doing to/for friendship.",

We will be especially attentive to how the approach to such things has shifted as Buddhism spread through Asia, and more recently to the rest of the world, as received by the 19th century Transcendentalists, the Beat poets, and socially engaged religion. Throughout the course we will consider the relevance of this material to our own views of the world and how we should lead our lives.",

From Algeria to Somalia through Libya, Mali and Nigeria, so- called Salafi jihadis have recruited and trained tens of thousands of combatants. Through cigarette and narcotic trafficking, hostage taking for ransom, and bank hold ups, they have procured huge financial resources, sophisticated weapons, and now constitute a serious security challenge not only to many countries of North Africa and the Sahel but also to their Western allies. This conference course will address the spread of jihadi groups in Muslim Africa (North Africa and the Sahel) after the cold war. The first part of the course will address the divergent theoretical interpretations of terrorism and address in particular the following questions: Is it greed that sustains civil wars or grievance? Does the root of terror lie in culture or politics? Is there any evidence that civilizations clashed after the cold war? The second part of the course will focus on select transnational Islamist movements, situated both in their local context of nation building and their larger regional contexts. Case studies will include Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in North Africa and the Sahel, the Harakat al-shabab al-mujahidin in the Horn of Africa, the Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region and the Gama\\'at islamiyya in Egypt and beyond.",

An additional feature of this main menu will be ample selections from films and works of fiction inspired by Rome, involving films by Rossellini, Fellini, Germi, Antonioni, De Sica, and Pasolini and novels by Moravia, Pasolini, Gadda, and Morante. In a fitting methodological twist, the continuing centrality of Rome in the age of globalisation will emerge from the application of key theoretical raedings by contemporary thinkers and planners.",

In the process we will examine the orthodoxy that Keynes attacked and that resurfaced in the 1960s and 70s; the key concepts underlying the models implicit in The General Theory; and the attempts of the Keynesian mainstream to make peace with both Keynes and orthodoxy. We will also explore the applicability of The General Theory to the long run. A final section will view the present economic difficulties through a Keynesian lens.",

These approaches have varied from the pragmatic strategies of Booker T. Washington, the socialist leanings of Rev. George Washington Woodbey, the \\\"poor people\\'s campaign\\\" of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the increasingly popular prosperity ministries of today\\'s neo-Pentecostal and Word of Faith communities. Such changes in strategies often coincide with changes in America\\'s political economy over the past century. This course attempts to interrogate the development of these various strands of economic thought using texts by scholars like Max Weber (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), E. Franklin Frazier (The Black Bourgeoisie), and David Harvey (An Introduction to Neoliberalism) as anchoring texts to frame the social, economic and political contexts in which these strategies emerge. Other texts, including autobiographies, ethnographies, and histories offer details of how these religious understandings are framed and practiced.",

This course introduces students to classic and contemporary theories of society, kinship, and citizenship by way of theorizing how economic production, sovereignty, and everyday life emerge through the regulation of relatedness. Anthropologists of the late nineteenth century and of the first half of the twentieth century turned kinship into a key domain for understanding social cohesion and political organization. In the past three decades -- following feminist, Marxist, and queer critiques -- anthropologists explored how discourses about kinship and the family anchored the ideologies and practices of modernity, colonialism, nationalism, and globalization. In this course, we ask: What can various forms of kinship teach us about the politics of social reproduction and the making of citizenship -- its modes of belonging and exclusion -- in the contemporary world?",

The first is how geographic mobility affects the faith and religious practices of diasporas, and the second how migration influences the development of religion in the sending and receiving countries of immigrants? After a critical evaluation of the concept of religion, seminar participants will look at pre-modern types of migration (forced and voluntary) and different religious traditions, and analyze the social and personal transformations provoked by migration. We will explore in particular theoretical perspectives on diasporas and look at the religious experience of Jews in Africa. We will also discuss various expressions of African religions in the new world, including Islam in Antebellum America, and Afro-American Religions, as well as the Islamic pilgrimage tradition in West Africa and its impact on state formation in pre-colonial Africa. The second part of the seminar will be focused on Muslim globalizations. Increasing numbers of labor migrants, students and refugees from Muslim countries have settled in Western Europe and North America in the last three decades. Their numbers are estimated at some 40 million in the early twenty-first century, an unparalleled presence in history. While Western societies are moving away from organized religion, Muslim immigrant communities, by striving to carve a niche in Western Societies, have followed the opposite direction. Although most Western societies recognize the freedom of worship, the multiplication of Muslim institutions (such as mosques, shops, restaurants, schools, cultural centers, newspapers, and charities) has created growing anxiety in the secularizing Western societies. We will look at how Muslim intellectuals mediate the integration of Muslim through the reinterpretation of Islamic theology, as well as how Western states grapple with the issue of Muslim integration in the post-September 11th context of War on Terror.",

We will first learn the fundamentals of Old English, which requires study as a foreign language. As we gain facility with the language, we will translate biblical narratives, sermons, and religious poems: some of them cautiously literal in their treatment of scripture, others fascinatingly hybrid. Ultimately, we will gain a sense of the development of English prose, and read some of the greatest poems in the English language.",

Is death a misfortune to the person who dies? How can death be a misfortune if you are no longer around to experience that misfortune? Is it possible to survive after death? What does it mean for you to survive after your death? Is there such a thing as an immaterial soul distinct from your body? Is immortality something you should want in the first place? Even if you do not live forever, is it nevertheless important that humanity continues to exist after your death?

We will debate money as a weapon system and whether or not it is a valid weapon technology. We will examine technologies introduced during the Global War on Terror (GWOT) and ask which category they fall in, if they were a true technological innovation, and if they facilitated victory in a battle vs war. We will discuss barriers to innovation and technological surprise on the battlefield.",

The course aims at a systematic understanding of the energy system\\'s environmental footprint as a tool to help students who will work to reduce it. Energy is a commodity. One cannot hope to re-shape the energy system to meet environmental constrains without a rough working understanding of energy markets--costs, prices and elasticities of supply and demand. So the course will integrate engineering economics and other applied social sciences into the treatment of energy technologies to enable a system\\'s view of energy.",

Language serves as a road map to comprehending how social, political, and economic institutions and processes develop: from kinship structures and the evolution of political offices to trade relations and the transfer of environmental knowledge. As a Social Engagement course, AAAS 20 will wed scholarly inquiry and academic study to practical experience and personal involvement in the community. Students will be given the opportunity to study Africans, their languages, and their cultures from the ground up, not only through textbooks and data sets but through personal relationships, cultural participation, and inquisitive explorations of local African heritage communities. Throughout the semester you will be asked to employ video production, ethnographic research, creative writing, \\\"social-portraiture,\\\" GIS mapping, and linguistic study as you engage with Africans, their languages, and their cultures. By examining linguistic debates and cultural traditions and interrogating their import in the daily lives of Boston-area Africans, we hope to bridge the divide between grand theories and everyday practices, between intellectual debates and the lived experiences of individuals, between the American academy and the African world. Ultimately, this course aims to place Africans themselves in the center of the academic study of Africa.",

In this class, we will discuss how to design data systems and algorithms that can \\\"scale up\\\" and \\\"scale out\\\". Scale up refers to the ability to use a single machine to all its potential, i.e., to exploit properly the memory hierarchy and the multiple CPU and GPU cores. Scale out refers to the ability to use more than 1 machines (typically 100s or 1000s) effectively. This is a research oriented class. Every week we will read two modern research papers; one from the scale up area and one from the scale out area. We will use examples from several areas, including relational systems and distributed databases, graph processing systems (i.e., for social networks), key value stores, noSQL and newSQL systems as well as mobile computing. Each student will work on a semester long data systems research project (in groups of 2-4 students) which can be in any of the above areas and will be based on an open research problem.",

Taking advantage of local museum collections, we will consider the tradition of the flawless classical god and goddess, how modern artists like Manet, Degas, Matisse and Picasso transgressed it, and, finally, how contemporary artists continue to radically transform the nude today. No experience with art history is necessary.",

Beginning with early work in the sociology of scientific knowledge and laboratory studies, students will read work in feminist science studies, field and environmental studies, multi-sited ethnography, sensory ethnography, and ethnographic accounts of digital worlds.

We will consider sports and higher education in the U.S. and at Harvard. We will also look at youth sports, sports as a business, the media and sports, and sports and health.

And why have the oppressed in turn often internalized these sorts of fictions and also produced counter-fictions that more or less conform to the same violent, phantasmic logic? In this course, we will explore how these fictions and counter-fictions are reproduced and challenged in some of the most powerful, canonical works of drama, fiction and cinema by South African and African American authors and filmmakers. As the Nigerian author, Chinua Achebe once famously remarked: \\\"where one thing stands, another thing will stand beside it.\\\" To this end, we will pay special attention in the course to how, both in form and in content, race and gender always seem, constitutively, to intersect in these fictions and counter-fictions. The course is thus a study in the dark, violent but generative cultural unconscious of modern racialized and gendered identities.",

The most promising advances in lung biology and respiratory disease are resulting from teams of scientists with diverse disciplinary training, including biology, medicine, engineering, and physics. In addition to a strong foundation in a specific discipline, the ability to recognize and act upon opportunities presented by outside disciplines is a crucial skill. This course is designed to train scientists to approach lung biology and respiratory diseases with an interdisciplinary perspective, in particular by bridging the gap between life sciences and physical/engineering sciences. With a focus on laboratory sciences and on mechanistic levels of understanding, course materials will cover 3 main problem areas: asthma, air pollution, and lung infection. The course consists of weekly course-meetings (lectures and case-studies) plus weekly research seminars from the physiology program. Students will gain skills in recognizing the relative strengths and weaknesses of different disciplinary approaches applied to pulmonary sciences, in designing interdisciplinary experiments effectively, and in interpreting interdisciplinary results critically.",

        "description": "This class will consider the study of race, ethnicity, and diaspora in relation to the digital world. Complex societal issues of power, domination, and bias follow us into digital spaces. Simultaneously, the much discussed digital divide has shifted from differential access to inequity in ownership, control, and content. The imagined democratizing promise of the digital exists in stark contrast to \\\"the other\\\". Individuals and collectives use digital technologies to reproduce and address notions of social difference. Hate groups actively recruit members and propagandize online via chat rooms, websites, social media, and virtual world games. Anti-racism organizations and individuals expose hate groups, educate on race and gender, transform the digital humanities to be more inclusive, and critique and advocate against faulty policies and stereotypical representations of minority groups. Digital environments are crucial spaces for research, critique, and social engagement on intolerance and inequality and simultaneously, positive ways of commemorating, representing, and engaging with shared experiences of race, gender, and ethnicity. Weekly workshops will feature expert guest visitors from a variety of interdisciplinary and cross-cultural backgrounds, and will be organized around a series of themes that are key to studies of race and technology. These workshops, open to faculty and students, will meet Thursdays from 11:30-1 pm. 30 students will be permitted to take this as a course; they will also meet on Tuesdays, 11:30-1 pm. Innovative assignments will develop student skills in digital research, content creation, and design.",

Since these techniques are at their essence novel ways to work with data, they should also have implications for social science. This course explores the intersection of machine learning and social science and aims to answer a few questions about these new techniques: (i) How do they work and what kinds of statistical guarantees can be made about their performance? (ii) How can they be used to answer questions that interest social science researchers, such as testing theories or improving social policy; and (iii) How might they open up new research questions? We will cover standard machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, statistical learning theory and nonparametric and Bayesian approaches. The goal is to create a working understanding of when and how they can be profitably applied. Students will be required to apply some of these techniques themselves, but we will not cover the computational aspects of the underlying methods. The course is aimed at PhD students with a solid background in statistical techniques, such as comes from the equivalent of a first year economics PhD econometrics sequence.",

        "description": "Approaching food as material culture that reveals complex social relations of power, this course begins with the examination of the larger historical processes of conquests and other uneven cross-cultural encounters that shaped the making and remaking of ethnic and regional identities of food. Then it investigates the political economy of transnational production, circulation, and consumption of food in various areas of the world. It also explores the cultural politics of how tastes of food are invested with corporate interests, and images and meanings of status distinction and inequalities. Finally, it examines the role of food in shaping ethnic/racial, national, and gender identities in the midst of globalization. To complement analytical approaches in classroom, this course may incorporate experiential learning components, including a visit to a local restaurant, a local farm, or a collaborative cooking exercise.",

Our focus on urban communities of concentrated poverty is intended to challenge students to think about policy solutions to complex problems. How do we respond to under-resourced schools, violence, joblessness, drug addiction and incarceration? Our methodological focus will be on qualitative data collection that includes ethnography and interviews. The last three weeks of the semester will be reserved for students to present original research projects designed to address the problems discussed in class. Questions for consideration: In what ways do various political, economic and religious ideologies shape our understandings of race? What kinds of practices lead us out of poverty? How do we understand justice? An optional visit to at least one Massachusetts state jail/prison will be incorporated into the curriculum.",

We will focus primarily on recently published work in the history and anthropology of biomedicine, as well as cultural theory, philosophy, and media studies addressing the life sciences. Throughout, we will pay special attention to where biologists have imagined the seat of vitality, whether organismic, cellular, genetic, or informatic. How has life recently entered into new circulations of capital, intellectual property, and political rhetoric as it is sequenced, synthesized, licensed, patented, cut up, frozen, cloned? What has life been, what has it become, and what will it be next?",

Ultimately we will use physical processes to explain the patterns of nature. Our treatment will be quantitative with applications to other phenomena, and based on sound physics.

While the course will briefly survey the historical development of Islamic and Muslim institutions in the region, its central focus will be the formation of identity - as expressed through language, literature, and the arts - among South Asian Muslim communities. The issues that influence these identities will be considered with regard to the constantly evolving religious and political contexts of South Asia. Special attention will be given to recent attempts to redefine Muslim religious identities through reform and revivalist movements as well as state policies of Islamization. We will look at the impact of these policies on issues such as the status of Muslim women, relations between Muslim and non-Muslims and the growth of sectarian tensions between Muslim groups. The course is appropriate for those who wish to acquire a bird\\'s-eye view of the Islamic tradition in South Asia, as well as those interested in exploring some of the issues confronting Muslim populations in contemporary times.",

As we examine a range of works including Thoreau\\'s Walden, Carson\\'s Silent Spring, and documentary movies, we will ask how each work presents nature to the reader through the medium of language, how each attempts to persuade the reader, and each draws upon sources as varied as literary romanticism and science.",

We investigate this transformation from the conversion of Saint Vladimir and the excesses of Ivan the Terrible through the Time of Troubles and the modern turn of Peter the Great. The class features close analysis of architecture, icons and frescoes, ritual, folklore, literature, and history to understand this shift in worldview, including the role of women. Special attention is devoted to the ways in which Medieval Rus is portrayed in film, opera, and ballet.",

How can seemingly disparate cases from around the globe enrich our conceptual understanding of economy and society? Has the economy become more global over time and, if so, how? What role does finance capital play in the current dynamics and future direction of the global economy? Starting with the evolution of economic organizations, the course covers topics such as social embeddedness, markets and networks, power, labor market, globalization, economic development, and financial markets.",

        "description": "<meta charset=\\\"utf-8\\\">From the eighth century on, the construction of gendered spheres in the fiqh assigns to women the capacity to dominate and control certain spheres, such as the sphere of reproduction, the education of children through the first years of their life, some schools of law also assign only to women the right to report to courts and the outer world on acts and persons they have seen in the gendered spheres dominated by women. The seminar will try to establish a full list of such gendered spheres under feminine control. The reasons by which such gendered spheres are justified by the jurists are many: the women\\'s intimacy has to be protected against the intrusion of the male gaze and touching that may stir the man\\'s and the woman\\'s sexual desire for each other. The seminar will discuss the growing list of reasons for additional veiling and seclusion in the writings of different schools of Sunni law. At the same time, an inverse development also takes place. The number of exceptional situations that require the uncovering of free (and slave) women in the presence of male strangers is constantly growing. Such situations as medical therapy or identification before a court require and justify the unveiling of women in the presence of strangers. As a result, a particular categorie of of women of high standing is developed who are exempt from these exceptions. We will try to follow the development of the casuistry on veiling and unveiling and to find a satisfying explanation for the many contradictions that characterize the arguments for veiling as developed in the legal literature of the classical period. Such an effort to come to terms with the notions of the legal development of veiling from the eighth to the nineteenth century will also allow us to understand better the fundamental change that has taken place in the functions attributed to veiling over the last 50 years.</meta charset=\\\"utf-8\\\">",

Issues range from the Arab Awakening and intervention in civil wars to combating Iran\\'s nuclear ambitions and dealing with the economic and military rise of China. Assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of issues and developing strategies in a government whose deliberations are discombobulated by leaks, reports about internal differences among policymakers, and press analyses. Students will learn to devise strategies and write strategic options memos as participants in the policymaking process. Strategic options memos combine careful analysis and strategic imagination, on the one hand, with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support, on the other. A subtheme of the course explores coping with a world where a pervasive press makes secrecy more often the exception than the rule. In each case, there will be exploration of how media coverage affects decision making, with an examination of WikiLeaks, the revelations about drones and secret, American-led cyberattacks, and other examples of the publication of classified information. Because of time constraints, Mr. Sanger will be joining a limited number of class sessions, and will join some remotely.",

A theatrical genre that traded in racist caricature, blackface minstrelsy was one of the most popular entertainments of the 19th century U.S., with a legacy that has continued into American popular music and culture today. This course explores the historical development and intense paradoxes of blackface performance by drawing upon materials in the Harvard Theatre Collection, which houses one of the largest minstrelsy archives in the world. The class will culminate in curating an exhibit. Core aspects of the course include grappling with complex questions of racial stereotyping and exploring the banjo in sound and image. Guest experts include a banjo virtuoso, a performer in an African American string band, and a minstrelsy scholar.",

In this course, students will learn to evaluate how unmet medical needs can be \\\"translated\\\" into new clinical practices. The course will feature assessment of unmet medical needs, case studies of successes and failures in translation, seminars from translational medicine experts, and workshops that engage students in substantive and intense discussions on current topics. Lecturers will include innovators who have successfully led the development of therapeutic interventions, leaders in basic science who have helped uncover the underlying causes of disease and investigators who have led clinical trials that lead to the approval of new interventions.",

In addition to acquiring a general knowledge of China\\'s history, participants in the course will be actively involved in creating materials for the online course; including producing videos, creating structures for content development, choosing texts and images for online discussion and mark-up, and participating in debates and discussions that will be shown to a world-wide online audience. We hope to do these modules in both English and Chinese versions, but knowledge of Chinese language is not necessary to participate. As presently conceived the course will aim to produce fifteen modules covering topics from the 8th to the 18th century. Topics will include political and institutional history, poetry, novels and short stories, art, social and economic change, and international relations among others. It is possible that the scope will be extended forward and backward in time. This is not a lecture course. There is no final examination. Grades will be based on both a self-assessment and a review of contributions to the modules by peers and faculty.",

We explore the ways we use our senses to taste food, and the intersection between sensual experiences and language. How do our senses interact with each other to constitute the taste experience and how do we verbalize it? How do individual sensorial experiences become part of broader social phenomena? A second strand of analysis will consider the relationship between food and systems of knowledge: how do we distinguish between safe and unsafe food and what is the difference between natural and industrial? The third strand of analysis will consider the question of how taste is formulated before it arrives to our plates. What are the conditions of production and circulation of food, and the connection between place and taste. We will read a variety of case studies with an emphasis on East Asia.",

        "description": "This course explores ways that psychological research indicating systematic departures from classical economic assumptions can be translated into formal models that can be incorporated into economics. Topics include ways utility theory can be improved--such as incorporating reference dependence, news utility, social preferences, self image, and other belief-based tastes--and ways we can relax assumptions of perfect rationality--such as incorporating focusing effects, limited attention, biased prediction of future tastes, present-biased preferences, biases in probabilistic judgment, and errors in social inference. The course will emphasize (a) careful interpretation and production of new evidence on relevant departures,(b) formalizing this evidence into models that can, with discipline and rigor, generate sharp predictions using traditional economic approaches, and (c) exploring economic implications of those models presented. Although we will primarily emphasize (b), the course is meant to be useful to students whose interests lie anywhere in this spectrum, under the premise that all such research will be improved by a greater appreciation of the full spectrum. The course is intended for PhD students in the Business Economics and Economics programs and others who have a solid background in microeconomic theory at the level of introductory PhD courses in these programs. While obviously appropriate to those wishing to specialize in \\\"behavioral economics\\\", the course is also designed for those interested in doing research in particular fields of economics. And while the course centers on theoretical models (learning and evaluation will center around solving formal problem sets), the theory is focused towards its empirical implementability and economic relevance, so that the course is also designed for those interested in theory-influenced empirical research.",

This course will offer students an in-depth examination of current knowledge regarding retinal diseases, molecular pathology, and therapy, with an emphasis on recent breakthroughs and discussion of key studies in the field. The class consists of lectures and group discussions that focus on seminal papers selected from both the basic science and clinical ophthalmology, which will serve as a basis for teaching students basic concepts of ophthalmology and becoming familiar with animal models of retinal diseases. Each session will review the landmark publications on a particular topic or disease. As the retina has long served a standard model for studying the CNS, the class will foster discussion on the implications of these studies in other disease mechanisms and therapy.",

The primary objective of the course is to provide students with the concepts and tools needed for planning and designing laboratory experiments, and for collecting and analyzing behavioral data. The course will also discuss other methodologies that may be helpful when working with field sites (namely, field experiments and surveys). A secondary objective is to provide students the foundations for the methodological evaluation of other behavioral researchers\\' work - a skill that will be helpful in their role as future academic reviewers. The course thus covers the designs and analyses that are most often used by experimental researchers in psychology, organizational behavior, and also marketing. The course will be hands-on and oriented towards providing technical skills for the design and implementation of laboratory experiments, including overcoming possible pitfalls and common barriers. The course assignment will be for students to write a proposal outlining the theory, design, power analyses, and proposed analysis for a laboratory experiment. Our hope is that the students will conduct the research during the course or afterwards, and that this course will help design and conduct impactful and rigorous behavioral research. Overall goal The overall goal of the course is for students to understand that how they design their experiment (all aspects of it) has a large role in whether they can answer their research questions. Please note that the course will begin on Monday, September 8th.",

Authors include James Baldwin, E.M. Forster, Nella Larsen, Virginia Woolf.",

The play, which took Italy by storm at the time of the 2011 political elections, will allow us to focus on the subject at war with the state from the perspective of the global negatives resulting from the management of the country as spectacle. As part of a close reading of this powerful intersemiotic critique of Italy as today\\'s Denmark, for today\\'s Hamlets, we will look into what, in the context of present day media regimes, continues to give stage performance the edge over other forms of creative critical citizenship. Extensive selected passages from Gadda\\'s major works will inform plenary seminars and student presentations encouraging intersections with other Catalogue courses via theory (from Agamben to Zizek), context (Italy in the 20thc, during the WWs, under facism and today) and content (individual resistence to imagined, coming and present communities).",

We will also explore questions specific to disorders common during this developmental period, such as whether adolescent mood and anxiety disorders are unidimensional or bideminsional constructs, and how recent social and neurobiological research can enhance our understanding of the unique challenges faced by adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Throughout the course, we will discuss research on emerging trends in media use and Facebook, and the impact of these technologies on depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and cyberbullying.",

By examining the connections between race and the development of legal and penal systems over time, this course investigates the historical process that eventually gave rise to the mass incarceration of black and Latino Americans in the late twentieth century. The course is structured according to the major punitive changes that often emerged after the expansion of constitutional and civil rights for African Americans. Our historical consideration will provide us the necessary background to address the ongoing consequences of racial disparities in the criminal justice system and the momentous public policy implications of this dynamic.",

Either sequence satisfies the organic chemistry requirement for medical school. Students may not count both Chemistry 17 and Chemistry 20 for degree credit. On the other hand, Chemistry 27 and Chemistry 30 cover different material, so students may choose to take both courses for degree credit; students should ordinarily take the third half course only after completing either the 17/27 or 20/30 sequence."

Moreover, it has increasingly been argued that the category of religion (along with that of the secular) is itself a modern creation. Readings will offer historical and contemporary perspectives on how distinctions between religious and secular, traditional and modern, have developed and been challenged over the past several centuries, by religious adherents and critics alike.",

Writing in 1950, Alfred Metraux, a Swiss-American anthropologist who became the Director of the UNESCO Division for the Study of Race Problems, captured the then prevalent view that race operated very differently in \\\"Anglo-Saxon\\\" and \\\"Latin\\\" America. He made reference to the \\\"favorable impressions produced by Brazil\\'s race relations\\\" and to the fact it had \\\"been hailed as one of the rare countries which have achieved a \\'racial democracy\\'.\\\" Whereas rigid forms of racial segregation characterized the United States, most countries in Latin America were seen as mestizo, racially-mixed nations that did not have a rigid color-line. Scholars have been debating the accuracy of these characterizations during the last sixty years. This seminar offers an introduction to this scholarship, assesses the current state of the field, and seeks to identify problems and questions for future research.",

        "description": "The aim of this seminar is to study the evolution of Islamic thought and political practices in Muslim societies from the 19th to the early 21st centuries. Attention will be devoted to the patterns of interaction between the Muslim World and the West because it is our assumption that these patterns contribute to influence ideological formations and modes of religious/political mobilizations in the Muslim World. By the end of the eighteenth century, much of the Muslim World was in \\\"decline\\\" whereas European imperial powers, mainly France and Great Britain, were on the rise. The course will explore the response of Muslim societies and intellectuals to the rise of European prominence. The major 19th century reformist movements that appeared in the Muslim World will be discussed, ranging from movements advocating mild reform to those rejecting all influence of \\\"Western civilization\\\" and advocating a return to the Tradition of Muhammad. In the twentieth century, virtually all the Muslim World came under European colonial domination. During colonial rule and after, the Muslim world experienced major transformations which affected the nature and administration of law, politics and society. It is in this context, that the new Islamic revival that some have called \\\"Islamism\\\" was articulated as an alternative to Westernization. The course will address the rise of contemporary \\\"Islamism,\\\" as an alternative to Western domination and modernization/Westernization. The major theorists of political Islam as well as the different trajectories of \\\"Islamism\\\" in diverse Muslim societies will be covered. The impact of political Islam in the West will also be addressed. The final part of the course will assess the trajectories of political Islam and address the ongoing debates on post-Islamism, secularism and modernity.",

The classes will consist of half lecture, half discussion. We will try to answer this simple, yet loaded question: What is an instrument?

Using primary sources (that is, work written by black intellectuals rather than about them), the course engages the idea of a \\\"black radical tradition\\\". The black radical tradition is bound together as a set of ideas that constructs and reconstructs philosophical and political connections across the rupturing history of black dispossesssion, displacement, and disenfranchisement. The black radical tradition, then, exists in dialectical tension with many of the key idioms of Enlightenment and liberal philosophy (freedom, progress, history, justice, civilization). We pay particular attention to how the black radical tradition has framed the relationship of black history to modernity and global historical developments; how it has posited black selfhood and black liberation over and against attempts to conscript the end of slavery into a seamless narrative about the triumph of liberal values; and finally, whether black desires and black life itself can ever be validated in the midst of ongoing anti-black racism.",

In the \\\"branches of the fiqh\\\" (furu&#8216; al-fiqh) this interpretation, since the eighth century, takes the form of the production of legal and ethical norms. From the tenth century on, the texts of the methodology of fiqh (usul al-fiqh) attempt to create the norms for norm production. We will discuss the norms and the methodology of the law as well as the institutions that allowed it to spread over the whole of the Muslim World. The course will consistently focus on the methods through which changes in genres of legal literature, methods, institutions and norms were introduced and recognized during different periods of the fiqh\\'s development. Special attention will be given to the changes that the system underwent from the 19th to the 21st century.",

More people converted to Islam during the six decades of European colonial rule than in the preceding thousand year of slow Islamization. The aim of this lecture course is to analyze contemporary West African Muslim societies with particular reference to the twenty and twenty first centuries. This course will look at how colonialism created a favorable ground for the spread of Islam. It will also address the main institutions and movements of modern Islam in West Africa as well as the postcolonial transformations in education, gender, the arts, interfaith relations etc. In addition to the discussion section in English, this lecture course will also offer a section in Arabic in which participants will be initiated to the intellectual production of Muslim intellectuals in Africa.",

Moreover, changes in Earth\\'s climate are raising sea level, changing precipitation patterns, and likely causing an increase in the occurrence of damaging storms, putting more of our increasing exposed global population at risk. In this course we develop an understanding of these natural hazards from an earth science perspective, and examine several case studies to assess their catastrophic impacts. Given our scientific understanding of these phenomena, we examine ways to assess and forecast future natural disasters, and to mitigate the adverse impacts to our societies. Sections will emphasize the use of GIS technology to measure the impacts of natural hazards.",

Housed at the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research (http://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/transition), Transition is the longest running Pan African cultural magazine in history. Founded in Uganda in 1961, the journal quickly became Africa\\'s leading intellectual forum. It was later edited by Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka in Ghana before arriving at Harvard in 1991, with publishers Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Kwame Anthony Appiah. Some of the best scholars and minds of the Diaspora have contributed to this journal, including Martin Luther King Jr., Chinua Achebe, James Baldwin, Julius Nyerere and many others. Students in this class will familiarize themselves with the history of Transition; chart new directions for the journal; identify topics of Pan African significance and potential contributors on those topics; and serve as critical readers of materials submitted for publication to the journal. Students will be listed in the issues of the journal they help produce as \\\"student associate editors\\\".",

How have nationalist and postcolonial politics been defined by gendered categories? Readings include case studies from west, east, and southern Africa, treating themes from the history of sexuality to the history of political culture.

Further advancements in networking are expected to similarly transform the technological landscape over the next decade through the emergence of the Internet of Things and gigabit wireless networks. In order to play a role in this era of new network-powered advancements, students must have a thorough understanding of emerging networking topics. Rather than teaching the basic networking protocols, which have become very mature and can be treated as a black box, in CS 143, we will teach the new issues and topics of interest which will power important emerging applications. This focus on upcoming applications is the motivation for CS 143 this semester. The class will be organized into the following nine modules: Basic Networking Concepts: Protocol Layering; Internet of Things: All-service Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Data Center Networking: Software Defined Networking; Web-scale Networking: Distributed Cloud Computing and Virtual Machine Migration; Content Networks: Video Streaming; Network Security: Defense Against Protocol Exploitation; Wireless Networking: Wireless Mesh, Geographic Routing; Machine Learning Assisted Networking: End-to-end Application Adaptive Protocols; Cyber-physical Networks: Vehicular Networking. Students will have the opportunity to implement the concepts learned in the course through programming assignments, read and discuss the latest networking literature, and design and implement a final project.",

In the second part of the course, we will discuss the issues of North Korean defectors, diaspora, migration and globalization, and the representation of otherness in South Korean films.

Readings include the most famous playwrights of both the 17th (Moliere, Corneille, Racine) and the 20th-21st centuries (Sartre, Badiou, Lagarce, N\\'Diaye). Special emphasis paid to the ideological power of images through theatrical workshops and video versions of recent productions. The final project consists of an excerpt to be performed in French.",

        "description": "The third seminar on Islamic Modernism focuses on the end of Arab Liberalism on the level of political parties and the loss of its intellectual focus and influence on the debates of modern Islam. Since the Nasser period liberal politics and liberal public debates have no longer been compatible with the types of authoritarian states that characterize the post-colonial period and that now claim to represent modernity. The Muslim mass movements that had attacked the state of the liberals find themselves also persecuted by new forms of military authoritarianism. It is the reaction to the Iranian Revolution of 1979 that requires a new outlook on Islam and its relation to modernity by Iranian and Arab intellectuals. It is in opposition to the authoritarianism of the Islamic Republic that Iranian intellectuals develop new forms of Islamic hermeneutics that open the horizon for a new understanding of Islam and of politics, leave more space for oppositional forces, and assign more importance to the struggle for more individual and collective rights. This new outlook is not restricted to Iran and to Shi\\'i intellectuals. The Iranian developments have encouraged a new understanding of Islam and a growing opposition against authoritarian states, developments that were visible since the 1990s also in the Arab world. The growing role of non-Islamist political activists during that period shows the widespread disappointment with the Muslim Brothers and the concept of an Islamic State, but it does not seem to lead to a renaissance of liberalism. The question which political and cultural role Islamic modernism is going to play in the near future is hard to answer. The seminar does not pretend to answer it.",

Throughout, the seminar will focus more generally on writing intellectual and disciplinary histories. Note: Open to advanced undergraduates with permission of the instructor.",

Through the study of narrative sources concerning the origin and nature of poets and poetry, theoretical and legal texts, and, most especially, bardic poems from the early Middle Ages through the eighteenth century, we examine the physical, public and political power of a medium-poetic verse-now associated with \\\"power\\\" in the private and emotional sense only. We study bardic poems in various modes - eulogistic, satiric, commemorative, prophetic - and we examine the circumstances that support the institution of bardic poetry and those that contribute to its decline. Among the issues to be considered are patronage, convention, the relationship of rhetoric and truth, and the functions of poetic form. All readings in English translation, but there will be some exposure to the forms of bardic poetry in the original languages.",

The course seeks to understand how and why international organizations have come to play such a significant role in the politics, economics, and culture of the modern world. We will consider the historical factors that have determined the structure, ethos, and efficacy of particular organizations and why international organizations arose in the first place. The course will combine that historical awareness with assessments of broader attitudes towards international organizations. That combination will help us to answer questions about the historical role of international organizations and their work. Why do we use the vocabulary of fighting wars when we discuss disease, for example? What do we actually expect of United Nations bodies and why? And why have historians only recently become interested in international organizations? More broadly, we will use the wide-ranging history of international organizations to rethink the role of the modern state as well as questions of peace, development, culture, and environment",

They learn ethnographic and design processes (observing, interpreting, ideating, testing, refining, planning) for identifying needs, practice applying insights from industry cases and research to move their ideas through organizational and political systems (e.g., negotiate, strategize, motivate others, and build support). Students get substantial tailored individual feedback on research-based factors linked to effective multi-disciplinary innovation at multiple levels (individual, team, organization) designed to help prepare them for entrepreneurial work in the future.

Although we lack recordings of live music and dance from this period, we do have an abundance of textual commentary on mousike as well as visual images of performance and instruments on Greek vases. The focus of the course will be the Greek musical imaginary, as we investigate how representations of mousike in Greek literature, philosophy, and art are linked with ideas about social structure, gender, ethnicity, education, the cosmos, and the self.",

Emerging from simpler levels of economic and political complexity, the Moche developed degrees of political and territorial organization never seen before in the region; developed into a peculiar form of multiple territorial states and, by the 9th century, collapsed and transformed themselves into rather different cultural manifestations. Thus they describe, full circle, the life and times of the first attempts to consolidate political structures of great complexity. In this course we will analyze several aspects of the processes in several regions, form the economic basis of the Moche states, the ideological basis for their legitimation systems, to their collapse and transformation to the even more complex Chimu and Lambayeque phenomena.",

It is also a portal to Chinese civilization. Encyclopedic in scope, this book both sums up Chinese culture and asks of it difficult questions. Its cult status also accounts for modern popular screen and television adaptations. Through a close examination of this text in conjunction with supplementary readings and visual materials, the seminar will explore a series of topics on Chinese culture, including foundational myths, philosophical and religious systems, the status of fiction, conceptions of art and the artist, ideas about love, desire and sexuality, gender roles, garden aesthetics, family and clan structure, and definitions of socio-political order.",

As a canonical figure across disciplines, he has fascinated and influenced thinkers as different as Pascal and Derrida. It is hard to overestimate his influence on Western theological, political, and philosophical thought. In addition to considering the major works, we will give ample space to his letters and sermons, which together constitute one of the richest biographical archives in the ancient world. By exploring this portrait in a landscape we will gain a deeper insight into the cultural, religious, and intellectual forces that were then transforming the face of the Mediterranean world.",

Others may focus on designing new products for everything from personal finance to healthy eating; products might be apps, financial vehicles or something more exotic. Others may focus on problems closer to home such as devising a way to keep students (themselves) from cramming.

Atlantic in scope, our studies will consider black US history in the context of broader regional variations, highlighting both the distinctive and the unexceptional features of black society, culture, and politics. Lectures, readings, discussions, and assignments will emphasize several key themes: the indispensability of slavery to the colonial development of the Americas, the entrenchment of race as a mode of categorical belonging and discrimination, the continuity of multivalent struggles for dignity, freedom, and equality, and the shaping force of gender, geography, and imperial warfare in the transformations of the period. Special attention will be paid to the interpretive possibilities of representing this history in the form of data, argumentative prose, storytelling, and works of visual art.",

How do discourses of racial, ethnic, and cultural difference shape the lived worlds of those they claim to represent? How does alterity emerge and how is it embodied by subjects of difference? And what is the role of globalization, commodification, and consumption in the regeneration, reconfiguration, or erasure of markers of difference? Students will revisit classic texts in postcolonial theory and critical race theory in order to explore how their conceptual insights can be translated into ethnographic practice and historical analysis. If anthropology has long been invested in various categories of difference, this course also sets out to rethink what the discipline can offer towards a critical investigation of the production of alterity in the (post)colonial world.",

Focusing on questions of race, class, nation, and migration(s) our course will create a dialogue among late nineteenth and early twentieth century canonical Caribbean thinkers such as Juan Bosch, and Eugenio Maria de Hostos and lesser-known contemporary writers like Rita Indiana Hernandez and Rey Andujar. Our course will be organized thematically, proposing a trans-national and trans-historical view of Caribbean intellectual and literary history.

The aim of the course is to place human beings in a universal and planetary context, and to see the steps in planetary evolution as an essential perspective on how we relate to Earth today. Topics covered include the Big Bang, origin of the elements, formation of minerals, origin of the solar system, formation of planets, climate regulation, origin of life, co-evolution of ocean, atmosphere, solid earth and biosphere, development of plate tectonics, the modern Earth as an interconnected system, and the human era and its consequences for the planet. Current environmental problems can then be considered in a planetary context. Finally we consider whether Earth may be a microcosm reflecting laws of planetary evolution that may be common to a class of planets throughout the universe, or alternatively may be a low probability accident.",

We start with Newtonian mechanics, which envisions a universal time, symmetric between past and future. This leads to the concept of a clockwork universe. We then see how developments in the 19th and 20th centuries destroy this view of time. In the 19th century, the distinction between past and future emerges from considerations of statistical processes. In the 20th century, the theory of relativity forces fundamental changes in the concept of time. Time ceases to be universal and becomes entangled with space and gravity. Quantum mechanics limits the predictability of the future and introduces verified effects so weird that Einstein wrote of them, \\\"No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this.\\\"",

Through ethnography, auto/biography, and documentary film, this class compares and contrasts the influence that religious moods and motivations have had on calls for democracy and social change in places like Latin America, the Middle East and West Africa.

We will begin with African-American blues in the early 20th century and moving through jazz, torch singing, folk, girl groups, disco, and contemporary song. Along their music readings we will include biographical, historical, and critical texts that will place these women in their artistic and political contexts. Performers studied will include, among others, Bessie Smith, the Boswell Sisters, Billie Holiday, Marian Anderson, Peggy Lee, Joan Baez, Gloria Gaynor, and Amy Winehouse.",

This course will trace the history of Enlightenment in primary sources, enriched by a collection of secondary readings, and will explore contemporary reflections on Enlightenment from various schools of thought, ranging from romanticism to marxism, and from feminism to postmodernism. Some of the themes addressed include the politics of the Enlightenment, philosophy and morality, rationalism and empiricism, science and education, and religion and toleration.",

As we examine a range of works including Thoreau\\'s Walden, Carson\\'s Silent Spring, and documentary movies, we will ask how each work presents nature to the reader through the medium of language, how each attempts to persuade the reader, and each draws upon sources as varied as literary romanticism and science.",

As people sought to survive and make sense of the disasters, social media as well as photos, videos and websites played critical roles. We examine the role of these records, using a participatory digital archive developed at Harvard. Student teams will develop research questions, collect digital material, and create multimedia narratives. Students will complement their research with study of responses to similar global events as well as critical reflection on digital scholarship and the emerging practice of \\\"crisis archiving.\\\"",

More specifically, we will study how Hollywood\\'s dream factory responded to dramatic challenges that states of crisis and emergency posed to the founding ideals of our democracy. We will look at the wide range of functions that commercial fantasy productions assumed, how they at times legitimated and bolstered the status quo, but at others also interrogated, exposed, and even indicted social inequity. Course films provide a representative sampling of classical American features from 1932 to 1969, including Scarface, It Happened One Night, The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, High Noon, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Manchurian Candidate, and Easy Rider.",

It is not so obvious what story could be told about modern Christian theology. Indeed, it may not be clear how much modern theology there has been in this sense--namely, theology written as deliberate response to a general crisis of form. This course will pose the question, what modernity means for writing about God. It will look within and beyond theology\\'s academic boundaries to a selection of formally deliberate texts in a variety of genres, from scriptural commentary to massmarket fiction. These texts will include works by Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Barth, Dorothy Day, Simone Weil, Leo Strauss, and Michel Foucault, among others.",

Policy and structural factors offer only partial explanations. Cultural factors also come into play, including cultural and social capital; parenting styles; teacher bias; teachers\\' and students\\' raced and classed language codes; college admissions priorities; and the experiences of first-generation college students on campus. Students will practice analyzing the methodology behind claims about the causes of educational inequality and learn to debunk flawed studies.

We will survey behavioral diversity and consistency across human societies, and we will gain insights into the adaptive significance of human behavior and social organization by reference to social dynamics in other species. Topics to be covered include cooperation, aggression and warfare, dominance and hierarchy, mating and pair-bonds, parenting, social learning, culture and religion.",

What are the implications of America\\'s \\\"civil religion\\\"? We will discuss the Puritan idea of a national covenant, the millennial rhetoric of the American Revolution, defenses of manifest destiny, the sacrificial theology of the Civil War, religious and political rationales for global missions, the rise of the Christian Right, and presidential invocations of America as a city on a hill. We will also examine how women\\'s rights leaders, abolitionists, and civil rights activists both critiqued and appropriated the image of America as a city on a hill.",

All three seminars focus on a notion of \\\"Modernism\\\" and \\\"Modernity\\\" that is not simply imported into the Middle East. We will, therefore, have to discuss concepts of \\\"Modernity\\\" that see modernity produced in Europe or the US and then imported into the Middle East in order to show their shortcomings. We will also have to look closely at discussions within the field of Islamic Studies that deny or defend the existence of an Islamic modernism before the second half of the 19th century. The underlying assumption of the course organization is that Islamic Modernism cannot be understood when it is cut off from the intellectual and religious history of the centuries preceding it. The first of these three courses will therefore focus on the 18th-century religious reform movements: the Muwahhidun in the Arabian Peninsula, the Sufi thinkers in Morocco, Sudan, Libya and Upper Egypt. These movements challenged dominant forms of scholastic thought, legal reasoning, and historical consciousness, as well as the barriers built by them that denied non-theologians and non-jurists the right to interpret revelation and Islamic normativity.",

This tradeoff will be quantified by a theory of approximation which measures the loss of performance of a simple, robust, and practical approximation mechanism in comparison to the complicated and delicate optimal mechanism.

What kinds of support (if any) should the state provide for families with children? Should parents and non-parents in a society share the costs of rearing children? What are the limits of family autonomy and parental partiality? We will take up these and related questions through contemporary writings in moral and political philosophy.

It begins with the distinction between notational, iconographic and phonetic communication-only the latter can truly be considered `writing\\' (a linear, graphic record of speech)-and then discusses the various different types of writing systems (including logographic, logosyllabic, syllabic and alphabetic scripts). This is followed by several case studies: the great decipherments (Egyptian, the Cuneiform scripts, Linear B and Mayan); scripts whose languages have become extinct (Etruscan and Meroitic); scripts that remain entirely mysterious (the scripts of Phaistos, the Indus Valley and Easter Island); the major scripts of the Pre-Columbian New World (Zapotec, Isthmian and Aztec writing); and invented scripts from popular literature. Each provides its own unique insights into the enduring and engaging mystery of writing.",

Through a range of published and unpublished readings, mostly from the last two decades, we examine improvisation as a central feature of individual and collective subjectivities.",

A wide range of media, from painting, sculpture, and print-making to photography, photomontage, video, installation, and performance art, will be considered. Situating the key aesthetic transformations that defined art\\'s modernity in a broader historical context, the course explores the fundamental role of advanced forms of artistic practice in the formation of modern culture and society.",
