## Course Objectives

Covers Internet programming concepts used to develop sophisticated applications for 
today's World Wide Web. This class focuses on client- side code development. In particular, 
we will look at how JavaScript and CSS can be used to develop web applications.    

This course is intense and a lot of material is covered; it is very important that you 
stay on schedule, take all quizzes and tests, and complete all assignments on time. It 
is very difficult to catch up if you get behind.   

To get a more complete view of web programming, CS2550 students are encouraged to 
also take CS3660, Web Programming II, which includes PHP and MySQL.   

### Course Philosophy

The premise for this course is that you learn by doing. In order to reach the objectives 
listed above you will need to practice doing those kinds of things: designing, 
implementing, testing and debugging web applications. The more practice you get, the 
more you will learn and the better you will understand the material. Keep in mind that 
you cannot learn web programming by sitting in class any more than you could learn to 
ride a bike by watching someone else ride.

## Lesson Structure

Students should read their UVLink email frequently and check the course web 
page (http://universe.tc.uvu.edu/cs2550) for changes and canvas for announcements. 
Students will turn in assignments on Canvas.    

Email to the instructor should be sent to micwright@uvu.edu and should have CS2550 in 
the subject line.      

The course is divided up into fifteen lessons. Each lesson has a reading assignment and 
some notes associated with it. Most lessons also have a quiz and some have a graded 
discussion question. Quizzes and discussion questions must be done during the lesson 
week to receive credit. Assignments are subject to change until the week of the associated 
lesson, so if you work ahead you might need to make some changes to your assignment.    

## Grades

Grades will be based on the following:   

* Quizzes	Extra Credit
* Web Programming Assignments	45%
* Final Project	15%
* Exams	30% (10% each)
* Quizzes and Discussion Questions	10%

### Grading scale:

* 93% and above	A	 	 
* 90% to 92%	A-	
* 87% to 89%	B+
* 83% to 86%	B	
* 80% to 82%	B-	
* 77% to 79%	C+
* 73% to 76%	C	
* 70% to 72%	C-	
* 67% to 69%	D+
* 63% to 66%	D	
* 60% to 62%	D-	
* 59% and below	F	 	 

**NOTE: The percentages shown in Canvas are not necessarily the percentages I use to determine course grades.** 
I post scores on Canvas so that students can check their individual scores, but the 
percentages on Canvas are not weighed correctly for calculating course grades. Canvas 
has limited options and doesn't allow me to set up grades the way I do in my spreadsheet.   

### Web Programming Assignments (45% of final grade):

There will be a number of programming assignments turned in for credit. All assignments 
are due as specified on the assignment page. Assignments (except for Assignment 0) will be 
due on **Mondays.**

**Late assignments will lose 10% per calendar day** (including weekends and holidays) 
after the due date. Assignments turned in more than 5 days after the due date will 
not receive any credit.   

I will use a recent version of Safari, Chrome, or Firefox to grade assignments, so please 
make sure your web applications work in one of those browsers. Also, I will not give any 
credit for programs with syntax errors or for code that does not produce any observable results.   

The assignments page explains how to turn in assignments.

Do not copy someone else's code or files or allow someone else to copy yours. 
You are welcome, and encouraged, to discuss assignments with others, get help from other 
students, and so on, but not by showing your code, looking at someone else's code, or 
working on assignment code together. There are no group projects in this course.     

If I find copied code, I will deduct a penalty from the scores of all students whose 
work contains the copied code, which could result in a score of zero for an assignment. 
That means that if you let another student read your code you might not get any credit 
on the assignment.     

Repeated incidents of copied code will result in more severe penalties, possibly including 
a failing grade for the course.
It's important to carefully follow the specifications for programming assignments and the 
project. Failure to follow the specifications can result in losing points and/or a delay in 
grading your project. I will not give credit for code that does not produce observable output.    

Please check your files before turning them in. If you submit the wrong zip file, forget to 
include a file, or need to resubmit for some other reason, there will be a resubmission 
penalty of at least 10%. There is no penalty for resubmitting an assignment before the 
due date.    

### Final Project (15% of final grade):

The final project is a web application. Most assignments will require you to write code 
that will be used in the final project, but you will need to do more for the project 
than simply finishing all of the assignments. For more information, see the project page.    

### Quizzes and Discussion Questions (10% of final grade):

Most lessons will have a quiz. Quizzes will be available on Canvas (https://learn-uvu.uen.org) 
for one week (from Tuesday to Monday). You are allowed two attempts for each quiz, with 
the highest score being the grade for that quiz. All quizzes have a time limit of 30 minutes.    

I will not give out copies of the quizzes, so if you don't take a quiz you will not have 
that quiz to study for the exams.    

Some lessons will have graded discussion questions. I will create a Canvas discussion with 
some open-ended questions and ask you to participate in the discussion by commenting on the 
questions in the forum. Any relevant, non-trivial post will receive credit, but everyone 
will benefit more from the discussion if you participate more than the minimum requirement.    

Usually one paragraph is a good length for comments in a discussion. Your comments don't 
need to be written formally, but they should show that you have thought about the issue 
and have something relevant to say about it.    

Occasionally I give a point or two of extra credit to discussion comments that are 
particularly informative, interesting, or well-written. Discussion questions will be 
weighted about the same as one third of a quiz. To receive credit, comments on discussion 
questions must be posted during the week of the associated lesson.     

### Exams (30% of final grade):

There will be two midterm exams and a final. Each test will count equally towards the 
final grade (each test represents 10% of your final grade). Exams may be taken in the 
testing center on campus or at a prearranged, proctored site. You must take all exams 
during the examination time period: missed exams cannot be made up. No books, notes, 
or web resources will be allowed in the exams.
