{"name":"CS 2550","tagline":"Web Development","body":"CS 2550 - Web Development\r\n================================================\r\n\r\nMichael Wright   \r\nOffice: Google Hangout   \r\nPhone: 801-753-8157   \r\nEmail: wrighmic@uvu.edu   \r\nOffice Hours: By Appointment   \r\n\r\n## Course Objectives\r\n\r\nCovers Internet programming concepts used to develop sophisticated applications for \r\ntoday's World Wide Web. This class focuses on client- side code development. In particular, \r\nwe will look at how JavaScript and CSS can be used to develop web applications.    \r\n\r\nThis course is intense and a lot of material is covered; it is very important that you \r\nstay on schedule, take all quizzes and tests, and complete all assignments on time. It \r\nis very difficult to catch up if you get behind.   \r\n\r\nTo get a more complete view of web programming, CS2550 students are encouraged to \r\nalso take CS3660, Web Programming II, which includes PHP and MySQL.   \r\n\r\n### Course Philosophy\r\n\r\nThe premise for this course is that you learn by doing. In order to reach the objectives \r\nlisted above you will need to practice doing those kinds of things: designing, \r\nimplementing, testing and debugging web applications. The more practice you get, the \r\nmore you will learn and the better you will understand the material. Keep in mind that \r\nyou cannot learn web programming by sitting in class any more than you could learn to \r\nride a bike by watching someone else ride.    \r\n\r\n### Textbook\r\n\t\r\nModern JavaScript: Develop and Design by Larry Ullman    \r\nPeachpit Press, ISBN 0-321-81252-2   \r\n\r\n## Lesson Structure\r\n\r\nStudents should read their UVLink email frequently and check the course web \r\npage (http://universe.tc.uvu.edu/cs2550) for changes and canvas for announcements. \r\nStudents will turn in assignments on Canvas.    \r\n\r\nEmail to the instructor should be sent to micwright@uvu.edu and should have CS2550 in \r\nthe subject line.      \r\n\r\nThe course is divided up into fifteen lessons. Each lesson has a reading assignment and \r\nsome notes associated with it. Most lessons also have a quiz and some have a graded \r\ndiscussion question. Quizzes and discussion questions must be done during the lesson \r\nweek to receive credit. Assignments are subject to change until the week of the associated \r\nlesson, so if you work ahead you might need to make some changes to your assignment.    \r\n\r\n## Grades\r\n\r\nGrades will be based on the following:   \r\n\r\n* Quizzes\tExtra Credit\r\n* Web Programming Assignments\t45%\r\n* Final Project\t15%\r\n* Exams\t30% (10% each)\r\n* Quizzes and Discussion Questions\t10%\r\n\r\n### Grading scale:\r\n\r\n* 93% and above\tA\t \t \r\n* 90% to 92%\tA-\t\r\n* 87% to 89%\tB+\r\n* 83% to 86%\tB\t\r\n* 80% to 82%\tB-\t\r\n* 77% to 79%\tC+\r\n* 73% to 76%\tC\t\r\n* 70% to 72%\tC-\t\r\n* 67% to 69%\tD+\r\n* 63% to 66%\tD\t\r\n* 60% to 62%\tD-\t\r\n* 59% and below\tF\t \t \r\n\r\n**NOTE: The percentages shown in Canvas are not necessarily the percentages I use to determine course grades.** \r\nI post scores on Canvas so that students can check their individual scores, but the \r\npercentages on Canvas are not weighed correctly for calculating course grades. Canvas \r\nhas limited options and doesn't allow me to set up grades the way I do in my spreadsheet.   \r\n\r\n### Web Programming Assignments (45% of final grade):\r\n\r\nThere will be a number of programming assignments turned in for credit. All assignments \r\nare due as specified on the assignment page. Assignments (except for Assignment 0) will be \r\ndue on **Mondays.**\r\n\r\n**Late assignments will lose 10% per calendar day** (including weekends and holidays) \r\nafter the due date. Assignments turned in more than 5 days after the due date will \r\nnot receive any credit.   \r\n\r\nI will use a recent version of Safari, Chrome, or Firefox to grade assignments, so please \r\nmake sure your web applications work in one of those browsers. Also, I will not give any \r\ncredit for programs with syntax errors or for code that does not produce any observable results.   \r\n\r\nThe assignments page explains how to turn in assignments.\r\n\r\nDo not copy someone else's code or files or allow someone else to copy yours. \r\nYou are welcome, and encouraged, to discuss assignments with others, get help from other \r\nstudents, and so on, but not by showing your code, looking at someone else's code, or \r\nworking on assignment code together. There are no group projects in this course.     \r\n\r\nIf I find copied code, I will deduct a penalty from the scores of all students whose \r\nwork contains the copied code, which could result in a score of zero for an assignment. \r\nThat means that if you let another student read your code you might not get any credit \r\non the assignment.     \r\n\r\nRepeated incidents of copied code will result in more severe penalties, possibly including \r\na failing grade for the course.\r\nIt's important to carefully follow the specifications for programming assignments and the \r\nproject. Failure to follow the specifications can result in losing points and/or a delay in \r\ngrading your project. I will not give credit for code that does not produce observable output.    \r\n\r\nPlease check your files before turning them in. If you submit the wrong zip file, forget to \r\ninclude a file, or need to resubmit for some other reason, there will be a resubmission \r\npenalty of at least 10%. There is no penalty for resubmitting an assignment before the \r\ndue date.    \r\n\r\n### Final Project (15% of final grade):\r\n\r\nThe final project is a web application. Most assignments will require you to write code \r\nthat will be used in the final project, but you will need to do more for the project \r\nthan simply finishing all of the assignments. For more information, see the project page.    \r\n\r\n### Quizzes and Discussion Questions (10% of final grade):\r\n\r\nMost lessons will have a quiz. Quizzes will be available on Canvas (https://learn-uvu.uen.org) \r\nfor one week (from Tuesday to Monday). You are allowed two attempts for each quiz, with \r\nthe highest score being the grade for that quiz. All quizzes have a time limit of 30 minutes.    \r\n\r\nI will not give out copies of the quizzes, so if you don't take a quiz you will not have \r\nthat quiz to study for the exams.    \r\n\r\nSome lessons will have graded discussion questions. I will create a Canvas discussion with \r\nsome open-ended questions and ask you to participate in the discussion by commenting on the \r\nquestions in the forum. Any relevant, non-trivial post will receive credit, but everyone \r\nwill benefit more from the discussion if you participate more than the minimum requirement.    \r\n\r\nUsually one paragraph is a good length for comments in a discussion. Your comments don't \r\nneed to be written formally, but they should show that you have thought about the issue \r\nand have something relevant to say about it.    \r\n\r\nOccasionally I give a point or two of extra credit to discussion comments that are \r\nparticularly informative, interesting, or well-written. Discussion questions will be \r\nweighted about the same as one third of a quiz. To receive credit, comments on discussion \r\nquestions must be posted during the week of the associated lesson.     \r\n\r\n### Exams (30% of final grade):\r\n\r\nThere will be two midterm exams and a final. Each test will count equally towards the \r\nfinal grade (each test represents 10% of your final grade). Exams may be taken in the \r\ntesting center on campus or at a prearranged, proctored site. You must take all exams \r\nduring the examination time period: missed exams cannot be made up. No books, notes, \r\nor web resources will be allowed in the exams.    \r\n\r\n[Course Schedule](http://universe.tc.uvu.edu/cs2550/schedule.html)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
